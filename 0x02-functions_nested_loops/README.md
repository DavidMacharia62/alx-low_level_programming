# FUNCTIONS - NESTED LOOPS
We progress in our learning of the c programming language by looking deeper at Functions, with a keen view of nested loops in c.

## Nested loops

In this project, we look at the various ways of working with functions and specifically nested loops in the c programming language. We do this with the help of a number of projects as described:-

- Task 1
- Task 2
- Task 3
- Task 4
- Task 5
- Task 6
- Task 7
- Task 8
- Task 9
- Task 10
- Task 11
- Task 12
- Task 13
- Task 14
- Task 15
- Task 16
